# sitemap-python
This is a simple python script using which you can generate HTML sitemaps for blogger, wordpress, tumblr, blog.com, and many other blogging platforms powered sites.

Most of the sitemaps creating websites are charging money if we exceed the limit by some number of pages. In the similar way as you would have faced, when I tried to create sitemap for my <a href="http://radiusofcircle.blogspot.com/">blog</a> the sitemap was incomplete becasue it had more than 500 web pages. 

Then this thought striked my mind. Why not create my own sitemap using python. And the result is what you see the code is infront of you. Hope you will like it :)

You can see the tutorial on how to use this script, the logic behind the code and all the other information from here:
